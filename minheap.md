# Tutor Hour Ticket Project

## In this project I crerated  a priority queue that would be able to take inputs of different tickets for tutor hours and order the students accordingly. 

### First I created a min heap that would be used to implement a priority queue for the waitlist:

### Then I created a class called Ticket for the prioirty queue. A ticket would give the student's name and what they need help with.

### Third, I utilized the prioirty queue to create a waitlist for students that show up to tutor hours online.
