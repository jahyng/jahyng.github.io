    <h1>In Store Navigator</h1>
        <p>
            The In-Store Navigator Kiosk is an attatchment for grocery shopping 
            carts to assist users with locating items in the store.

    <h2>Process</h2>
        <h3>Proposal</h3>
        <p>
            The first step was to collect data from interviews and online 
            research about how the average shopping experience is for the 
            general population.
        </p>
        <h3>Lo-fi Prototype</h3>
        <p>
            For the lo-fi prototype, our team used Figma to create a short flow
            that depicts the main aspects and functions of our interface.
