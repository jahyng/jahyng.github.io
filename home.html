                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>I am a fourth year at UC San Diego. Some of my interests are 
                    surfing and playing guitar. I enjoy listening to music and 
                    creating. I love to build various things as I have completed
                    personal projects including building my own surfboard rack
                    and electric guitar. I really enjoy breaking things down and
                    learning how they function, and that is a big reason why I
                    built this website, wanting to learn how websites are made.
